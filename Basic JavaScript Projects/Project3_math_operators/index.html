            <p id = "Math" onclick = "subtraction()">Click here!</p>
            <p>Since I created a subtraction function as part of step 81, I will create a multiplication function for step 83:</p>
            <p id = "Math2" onclick = "multiplication()">No, click on me!</p>
            <p>I guess now I just need a division problem:</p>
            <p id = "Math3" onclick = "division()">Don't forget to click here as well.</p>
            <p>Here is an addition function, just because:</p>
            <p id = "Math4" onclick = "addition()">Might as well click here too.</p>
            <p>The following is a multiple-operation problem:</p>
            <p id = "Simple" onclick = "multiple_operators()">How about clicking on this!</p>
            <p>Remainders can also be given:</p>
            <p id = "Modulus" onclick = "remainder()">Click again</p>
            <p>The following uses a negation operator to give the opposite of the value of x:</p>
            <p id = "Negate" onclick = "negation_operator()">Click for the opposite value.</p>
            <p>See the increment and decrement operators work:</p>
            <p id = "increment" onclick = "increment_operator()">Click for an increment.</p>
            <p id = "decrement" onclick = "decrement_operator()">Click for a decrement.</p>
            <p id = "PI" onclick = "Math_PI()">Click for Math: PI = </p>
            <p id = "power" onclick = "Math_Power()">Click for an exponent.</p>
